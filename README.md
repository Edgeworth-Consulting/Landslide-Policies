# Landslides: Tackling the Poverty Trap

## Landslides and Poverty
Landslides are a catastrophic disaster for communities across the world, but especially for already vulnerable ones. Landslides decimate livelihoods and community wealth. Repeated disasters in landslide susceptible areas can trap vulnerable communities in a cycle of poverty. 

## Project Plan
We aim to break this cycle with 3 key steps of analysis:

1. Landslide Susceptibility Rating
- How likely is it that a community will face landslides?
- What areas are most susceptible to landslides?

2. Socio-Economic Risk Evaluation
- What is the community cost of a landslide?
- What is the cost of an insurance policy?

3. Actionable Policy Recommendations
- How can a community reduce the risks of landslides?
- What steps can you take to face landslides?
